    description: "Hello, my name is Lara Kim, and I'm a senior studying Computer Science and Mathematics at NYU. I was born in Syracuse, New York, but moved to Seoul, Korea when I was four years old. I went to and graduated from an international school in Korea. \n My interests include playing sports such as soccer and volleyball, traveling, watching movies/tv shows, and of course, working on coding projects. I was first introduced to coding and software development during highschool, when I took AP courses on Computer Science. I started off creating basic, simple apps and websites through these courses and found that this field of study involves both creativity as well as rationality. As a person who values both facets, I felt I would enjoy a career in software engineering. I hope to continue to grow as a software engineer, and believe that this course will help me do so. \n Thanks for reading!",
